        I'm Gavin! Welcome to my site. This is literally a thought experiment, and I have no idea what I'm doing. <strong>Welcome to the circus.</strong>

<h2>
    This is really meant as an exploratroy place for me to understand how and what I can build with HTML and a few other coding ideas.<br>
    Right now, transparently, I am literally just trying to prove to myself that it is possible for me to build something functional. <br>
    Wish me luck!
