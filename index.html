    This is really meant as an exploratory place for me to understand how and what I can build with HTML and a few other coding ideas.<br>
    Right now, transparently, I am literally just trying to prove to myself that it is possible for me to build something functional. <br>
    Wish me luck!

    "“What happens to a wanderer?” Moses asked Neph. “Does he ever come home?” And Neph answered ruefully that wanderers were those who sought their home – not those who left it. The cryptic intent was not lost on Moses, and when Neph asked him how he felt, he replied, “I am a stranger here.”" - Howard Fast
